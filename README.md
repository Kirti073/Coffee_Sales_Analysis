# Coffee Sales Prediction Project

This project aims to predict coffee sales using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features such as transaction datetime, coffee types, payment methods, and sales amounts. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and removing outliers using the Z-score method.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features were extracted from the datetime column, and categorical variables were one-hot encoded.
3. **Modeling**: A Random Forest model was trained to predict coffee sales based on the engineered features.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance was assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score, achieving high accuracy.

### Results:
The model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, indicating that coffee types and seasonal factors significantly influence sales.

This project provides insights into coffee sales trends and showcases the application of machine learning in retail analytics.
